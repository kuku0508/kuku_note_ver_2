4.10
In a study on the effects of AZT in slowing the development of AIDS symptoms,338 veterans whose immune systems were beginning to falter after infection with the AIDS virus were randomly assigned either to receive AZT immediately,and whether AIDS symptoms developed during the three-year study. 

a.what null hypothesis is tested by the difference between the null devuance and the residual deviance?Interpret.

b.Explain how to set up indicator variables for azt and race to obtain the estimates shown.

Table 4.11 shows estimeted effects for a logistic regression model for $y=presence\, of \,squamous\,cell\,esophageal\,cancer(1=yes,0=no)$.Smoking status(s) equals 1 for at least one pack per day and 0 otherwise,alcohol consumption(a) eqia;s the average number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day,and race(r)equals 1 for blacks and 0 for whites.
a.To describe the race-by-smoking interaction,construct the prediction equation when $\tau=1$ and again when $s=0$ .Find the fitted conditional odds ratio for the race effect for each case.(For each association,the coeffictent of the cross-product term is the difference between the log odds ratios at the two levels for the other variable.)

b.In table 4.11,what do the coefficients of smoking and race represent?What hypotheses do their P-values refer to?
