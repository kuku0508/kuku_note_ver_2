1. Using R and SAS, find the determinant, trace, inverse, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the matrix A, where：
$$
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
13&-4&2\\
-4&13&-2\\
2&-2&10
\end{bmatrix}
$$
2. In an effort to develop improved peanuts, crop scientists routinely compare varieties with respect to several variables. A two-factor experiment with two replications was considered. Three varieties were grown at two geographical locations, and the three variables representing yield, sound mature kernels（SMK, weight in grams）and seed size（weight in grams）were measured. The data are shown as follows. Test the effects at $\alpha=0.05$ and make your conclusion.
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
\text{Factor 1 Location}&\text{Factor 2 Location}&Y_ㄅ\text{}
\end{array}
$$
