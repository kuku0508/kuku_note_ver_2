## Exercise 3.21：
Griffiths（E25）reported data on the extent of coffee-berry disease on farms not sprayed and on those sprayed with a fungicide. The results are shown in Table 3.39, in therms of percentage infections in test berries. Do these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in population ocation parameters？Let $\alpha=0.01$. Use the Mann-Whitney test and determine the P-value.

**Extent of coffee-berry disease(percentage infections in test berries) on farms sprayed and not sprayed with a fungicide**
$$
\begin{array}{lccccccc}
\hline
\text{Unsprayed}&6.01& 2.48&1.76&5.10&0.75&7.13&4.88\\
\\\text{Sprayed(at least} \\\text{14 months prior to sampling)}&5.68&5.68&16.30&21.46&11.63&44.20&33.30
\end{array}

## Exercise 3.36：
A manufaturer compared the viscosity of two brands of motor oil.A simple random sample of specimens of brand A and an independent simple random sample of specimens of brand B yielded the results（coded for ease of computation）shown in Table 3.54. CAN we conclude on the basis of these data that the viscosity of brand A is more variable than the viscosity of brand B？Use the Ansari-Bradley test.Let$\alpha=0.05$.

**Data for Exercise 3.36**
$$
\begin{array}{lcccccccccccccccc}
\hline
\text{Brand A}&25&39&35&18&50&11&42&47&19&16&45&41&25&32&44&35\\

 \text{Brand B}&59&37&36&65&42&33&56&36&64&55&61&63&57&33&37&60\\
