Suppose that $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ is a random sample from the following distribution.
$$
f(x;\theta)=\frac{\theta}{(1+x)^{\theta+1}},\quad0<x<\infty,\quad and \quad 0<\theta<\infty.
$$
1. Does this distribution belong to exponential family? State your reason.
2. Find a sufficient statistic for $\theta$.
