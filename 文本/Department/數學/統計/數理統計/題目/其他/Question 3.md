Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ be a random sample from Poisson distribution with parameter $\theta$.
1. What is the support of Poisson distribution?
2. What is the parameter space of Poisson distribution?
3. Show that the Poisson distribution is of the one-parameter exponential family.
4. Let $T=\sum^n_{i=1}X_i$ . Use the defintion to show that $T$ is a sufficient statistic for $\theta$.
5. Use the factorization theorem to show that T is a sufficient statistic for $\theta$.
6. Is $T$ a minimal sufficient statistic? Why?

1. 可能要先翻譯一下，反正所謂support of Poisson distribution
   就是指「隨機變數可能取到、且機率為證的所有值」
