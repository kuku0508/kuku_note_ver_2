# 問題：
For a particular type of resistor, specifications are LSL = 0.000 and USL = 0.700 $\Omega$. A representative sample of 10 resistors is selected for use in a meaurement systeam evaluation.
Three operators are then asked to use an LCR(inductan, capacitance, resistance) meter to obtain two measurement for each resistor. The measurements, obtained in a completely random order, follow. Determine the values of %R&$\text{R}_{\text{tolerance}}$ and %R&$\text{R}_{\text{process}}$ for this study. Is the measurement system acceptable?
