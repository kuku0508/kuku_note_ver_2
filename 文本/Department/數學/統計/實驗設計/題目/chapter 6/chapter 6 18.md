# 問題：
For a particular type of resistor, specifications are LSL = 0.000 and USL = 0.700 $\Omega$. A representative sample of 10 resistors is selected for use in a meaurement systeam evaluation.
Three operators are then asked to use an LCR(inductan, capacitance, resistance) meter to obtain two measurement for each resistor. The measurements, obtained in a completely random order, follow. Determine the values of %R&$\text{R}_{\text{tolerance}}$ and %R&$\text{R}_{\text{process}}$ for this study. Is the measurement system acceptable?
$$
\begin{array}{r|ccc}
&&Operator\\
Part&1&2&3\\
\hline
1&0.417&0.394&0.404\\
&0.419&0.968&0.401\\
2&0.417&0.387&0.398\\
&0.741&0.99&0.402\\
3&0.423&0.389&0.407\\
&0.418&0.407&0.402\\
4&0.412&0.389&0.407\\

\end{array}
