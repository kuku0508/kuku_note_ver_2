# 問題：
Consider a three-factor experiment where factor A is at a levels, factor B at b levels, and factor C at c levels. The experimemt is to run in a completely randomized manner with n observations for each treatment combination. Assuming that factor A is run at a random levels and both B and C at fixed levels, determine the EMS column and indicate what tests would be made after the analysis.
