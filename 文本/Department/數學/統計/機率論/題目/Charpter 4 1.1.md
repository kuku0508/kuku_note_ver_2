Let X and Y be r.v's denoting, denoting, respectively, the number of cars and buses
lined up at a stoplight at a given point in time, and suppose their joint p.d.f. is
given by the following table:

Calculate the following probabilities:
(i) There are exactly four cars and no buses.
(ii) There are exactly five cars.
(iii) There is exactly one bus.
(iv) There are at most three cars and at least one bus.
# 答案
X是在給定的點紅燈時，車子的數量；Y是在給定的點紅燈時，巴士的數量。
(i)
要我們找出四輛車還有沒有巴士的情況，那我們就需要去看當今天 $x=4$、$y=0$的情況。
那我們可以看到在表格中，機率就是0.060。
