# 問題
In a sociological project, families with 0, 1, and 2 children are studied.
Suppose that the numbers of children occur with the following frequencies:
$$
\text{0 children}:30\%;\quad\text{1 child}:40\%;\quad\text{2 children}:30\%;
$$
Let X and Y be the r.v.’s denoting the number of children in a family from the
target population and the number of boys among those children, respectively.
Finally, suppose that P(observing a boy) = P(observing a girl) = 0.5.
Calculate the joint p.d.f. fX,Y(x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y), 0 ≤ y ≤ x, x = 0, 1, 2.
Hint. Tabulate the joint probabilities as indicated below by utilizing the
formula:
