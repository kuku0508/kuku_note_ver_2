## Problem 2.4
Table B.3 presents data on the gasoline mileage performance of 32 different automoblies.

a. Fit a simple linear regression model relating gasoline mileage y(miles per gallon) to engine displacement $x_1$ (cubic inches).

b. Construct the analysis-of-variance table and test for significance of regression.

c. What percent of hte total variability in gasoline mileage is accounted for by the linear relationship with engine displacement?

d. Find a 95% CI on the mean gasoline mileage if the engine displacement is 275 in$.^3$

e. Suppose that we wish to predict the gasoline mileage obtained from a car with a 275-in$.^3$ engine.Give a point estimate of mileage.Find a 95% prediction interval on the mileage.

f. Compare the two intervals obtained in parts d and e . Explain the differnce between them.Which ine is wider,and why?

## Problem 2.5
Consider the gasoline mileage data in Table B.3. Repeat Problem 2.4(parts a , b and c ) using vehicle weright $x_{10}$ as the regressor variable . Based on a comparison of the two models, can youconclude that $x_1$ is a better choice of tegressor that $x_{10}$.
