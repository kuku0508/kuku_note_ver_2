## Exercise 8.2
Table 8.40 shows the ages of samples of 10 men and 10 women who are employed by a state government. Can one conclude on the basis of these data that the age compositions of the two populations are different?Use a 0.05 level of significance.

**Table 8.40.  Age of 10 men and 10 women employed by a state government**
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\hline
\text{women}&21&37&35&54&31&33&42&27&47&26\\

## Exercise 9.33
In an animal-behavior study, 15 domestic animals reared together were ranked according to their relative positions in the group's pecking order and also on the basis of their "friendliness" toward humans. The results are shown in Table 9.44. Compute $r_s$ and determine whether one can conclude that animals higher in the pecking order tend to be friendlier toward humans.
