## Exercise 3.21：
Griffiths（E25）reported data on the extent of coffee-berry disease on farms not sprayed and on those sprayed with a fungicide. The results are shown in Table 3.39, in therms of percentage infections in test berries. Do these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in population ocation parameters？Let $\alpha=0.01$. Use the Mann-Whitney test and determine the P-value.

**Extent of coffee-berry disease(percentage infections in test berries) on farms sprayed and not sprayed with a fungicide*
$$
\begin{array}{lccccccc}
\hline
\text{Unsprayed}&6.01& 2.48&1.76&5.10&0.75&7.13&4.88\\
\\\text{Sprayed(at least} \\\text{14 months prior to sampling)}&5.68&5.68&16.30&21.46&11.63&44.20&33.30
