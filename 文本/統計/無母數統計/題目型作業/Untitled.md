Group 2 contained six children who had received additional pulmonary radiotherapy or thoracic surgery or both. Group 3 consisted of eight children who received no irradiation directed primarily to the lung. Vital capacity values,expressed as percentages of predicted values vbased on standing height, for subjects in the three groups are shown in Table 6.17. Test the null hypothesis of no difference among the three populations represented against the order：$\text{group 2}\leq\text{group 1}\leq\text{group 3}$. Determine the P-value.
