## Exercise 6.10
Wohl et al.(E13) studied the physiological properties of the lungs in patuents who received therapeutic bilateral pulmonary irradiation in early childhood. Their subjects consisted of three groups of children. Group 1 was composed of six childhood. Their subjects consisted of course of bilateral pulmonary irradiation. Group 2 contained six children who had received additional pulmonary radiotherapy or thoracic surgery or both. Group 3 consisted of eight children who received no irradiation directed primarily to the lung. Vital capacity values,expressed as percentages of predicted values vbased on standing height, for subjects in the three groups are shown in Table 6.17. Test the null hypothesis of no difference among the three populations represented against the order：$\text{group 2}\leq\text{group 1}\leq\text{group 3}$. Determine the P-value.


**Vital capacity values,expressed as percentage of predicted values based on standing height, in three groups of subjects**

##### Group 1：Bilateral pulmonary irradiation
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\hline
&71&57&85&67&66&79
\end{array}
$$
##### Group 2：Additional pulmonary irradiation or thoracic surgery
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\hline
76&94&61&36&42&49
\end{array}
$$
##### Group 3：No pulmonary irradiation
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\hline
80&104&81&90&93&85&101&83
\end{array}

## Exercise 7.2
Perry et al.(E2)determined plasma epinephrine concentrations during isoflurane, halothane, and cyclopropane anesthesia in 10 dogs. The results are shown in Table 7.9. Do these data suggest a difference in treatment effects?Find the P-value.

**Change in response time(milliseconds) of 10 subjects after receiving one of three drugs**

\hline
A&10&10&11&8&7&15&14&10&9&10\\
