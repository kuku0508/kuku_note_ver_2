## Exercise 3.10
Von Burg and Rustam (E15) reported values of the median nerve motor conduction velocity shown in Table 3.23. Experimental subjects admitted to a hospital had been diagnosed as having methylmercury poisoning and as having eaten contaminated bread. The controls were members of the hospital personnel who had presumably escaped exposure to the contaminated bread. Do these data provide suffcient evidence to indicate that the populations represented by the two samples have different distributions?Let $\alpha = 0.025$.
