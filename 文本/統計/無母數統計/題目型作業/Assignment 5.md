## Exercise 3.10
Von Burg and Rustam (E15) reported values of the median nerve motor conduction velocity shown in Table 3.23. Experimental subjects admitted to a hospital had been diagnosed as having methylmercury poisoning and as having eaten contaminated bread. The controls were members of the hospital personnel who had presumably escaped exposure to the contaminated bread. Do these data provide suffcient evidence to indicate that the populations represented by the two samples have different distributions?Let $\alpha = 0.025$.

## Exercise 3.15
Gill and Murray（E19）conducted an experiment designed to test discrimination of song ability among blue-winged and golden-winged warblers（Vermivora pinus and
V . chrysopetra）of southeastern Michigan.Within the hearing range of territorial malesm te experimenters played tape recordings of songs of the listening bird and songs of the other species. Discminatory behavior of the birds was based on whether they reponded to the recordings. Table 3.33 shows 22 birds classified according to species and discriminatory behavior. Can we conclude on the basis of these data that the proportion on nondiscriminators is higher among golden-wings than amoong blue-wings ? Let $\alpha = 0.05$. Determine the P value.

\text{Species}&\text{Discriminaotrs}&\text{Nondiscriminators}&\text{Total}\\

\text{Michigan golden-wings}&3&9&12\\
