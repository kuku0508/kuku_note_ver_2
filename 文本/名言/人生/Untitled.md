我會跟他談談的，搞不好他會聽我的話。但是從世界現在的情況來看，我們也是在拖延無可避免的未來罷了。但如果能換來一點時間建立更美好的東西，延長生命的時限，哪怕只是一點點。至少我認識一個在逆境中也不輕言放棄的女人。

Sam：I'll talk to her.Maybe she'll listen. But with the shape the worlds in, it'll only be delaying the inevitable.Still,if it buys us time to try and build something better.A new lease on life,at least for a little bit.Well, I can think of one woman who made the most of a chance like that.Nothing lasts forever.Not even the world.But we gotta keep it going as long as we can, right? Patch the holes,change the parts, all that.So we can say we had a good run. That we lived.

Fragile：Thought you didn't like havubg to handle things with care.

Sam：Cause it was hard enough keeping my own shit together. Back when we met at the cave, the only thing I cared about was making it to the next sunrise. Sure as hell didn't care about America or "The Future."
