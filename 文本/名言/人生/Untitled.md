Sam：I'll talk to her.Maybe she'll listen. But with the shape the worlds in, it'll only be delaying the inevitable.Still,if it buys us time to try and build something better.A new lease on life,at least for a little bit. Well, I can think of one woman who made the most of a chance like that. Nothing lasts forever.Not even the world.But we gotta keep it going as long as we can, right? Patch the holes,change the parts, all that.So we can say we had a good run. That we lived.

山姆：我會跟他談談的，搞不好他會聽我的話。但是從世界現在的情況來看，我們也是在拖延無可避免的未來罷了。但如果能換來一點時間建立更美好的東西，延長生命的時限，哪怕只是一點點。至少我認識一個在逆境中也不輕言放棄的女人。沒有事情是永恆的，這個世界也一樣。但只要這世界還在，我們ru,得活下去，對吧？修修補補，努力維持生活。這樣至少我們能問心無愧地說，我們活過了。

Fragile：Thought you didn't like having to handle things with care.

翡若捷：我還以為你討厭要小心呵護的東西呢。

Sam：Cause it was hard enough keeping my own shit together. Back when we met at the cave, the only thing I cared about was making it to the next sunrise. Sure as hell didn't care about America or "The Future." I was liveing a lie, hung up on past regrets. I was broken. But somewhere along the way, I started changing. Started meeting perple that made me think that maybe it wasn't all bad. People that put their faith in tomorrow and in me. That kept the lights in and waited for hope to arrive.So I gotta deliver, for their sake.

山姆：因為在以前，光是要顧好自己就夠難了。我們在洞穴相遇那時，我只求活著看到第二天的日出而已。我一點也不在意美國跟「未來」。我活在謊言跟悔恨中，破碎不堪。
但是不知道從哪時候開始，我改變了。我遇見了許多人，讓我發現這世界或許沒這麼糟。這些人把希望寄託在明天跟我身上。他們因此得以撐下去，繼續等待希望到來。所以為了他們，我不能停下腳步。

Deadman：Even if it means you never come back?

Sam：Fucked if I do, fucked if I don't, right? Take care of Lou.

山姆：橫也是死，數也是死
