Clifford Unger：When I found out I was gonna be a father… I was so scared. Scared of what it would mean… I had to be there for you and your mom… no matter what. I couldn’t just go off and get myself killed anymore… couldn’t leave you all alone. I couldn’t. I had it all wrong… all wrong. Being a father… didn’t make me scared. It made me brave. I’m sorry… sorry it took me so long… Don’t make the same mistake. Be yourself… be free.

我發現自己要當爸爸的時候...非常害怕。很怕這個重責大任。
