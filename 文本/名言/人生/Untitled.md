Sam：I'll talk to her.Maybe she'll listen. But with the shape the worlds in, it'll only be delaying the inevitable.Still,if it buys us time to try and build something better.A new lease on life,at least for a little bit. Well, I can think of one woman who made the most of a chance like that. Nothing lasts forever.Not even the world.But we gotta keep it going as long as we can, right? Patch the holes,change the parts, all that.So we can say we had a good run. That we lived.

山姆：我會跟他談談的，搞不好他會聽我的話。但是從世界現在的情況來看，我們也是在拖延無可避免的未來罷了。但如果能換來一點時間建立更美好的東西，延長生命的時限，哪怕只是一點點。至少我認識一個在逆境中也不輕言放棄的女人。沒有事情是永恆的，這個世界也一樣。但只要這世界還在，我們ru,得活下去，對吧？修修補補，努力

Fragile：Thought you didn't like havubg to handle things with care.

Sam：Cause it was hard enough keeping my own shit together. Back when we met at the cave, the only thing I cared about was making it to the next sunrise. Sure as hell didn't care about America or "The Future." I was liveing a lie, hung up on past regrets. I was broken. But somewhere along the way, I started changing. Started meeting perple that made me think that maybe it wasn't all bad. People that put their faith in tomorrow and in me. That kept the lights in and waited for hope to arrive.So I gotta deliver, for their sake.

Deadman：Even if it means you never come back?

Sam：Fucked if I do, fucked if I don't, right? Take care of Lou.
