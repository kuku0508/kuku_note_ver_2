Clifford Unger：They told me your name was Sam Porter...But you are Sam Bridges.
My Son, my bridge to the future. Without you, I was just like any other cliff.A dead end. No way forward. Nothing but an obstacle-Looking in at the world, people like you were trying to build. Dividing people was the only thing I was ever good at.


克里夫：聽說你的名字是山姆．波特，可是你是山姆．布橋斯才對。你是我的兒子，是我通往未來的橋樑。如果沒有你，我就像是一座懸崖。死路一條，無法前進。我眼前是個無法跨越的障礙，只能遠遠看著你們努力打造的世界。我唯一擅長的事情只有使人們疏離。

Clifford Unger：But not you,Sam.You bring people together. You're their bridge to the future...... and mine. Come on Sam. Stand up.

克里夫：但你不一樣，山姆。你讓大家團結在一起。你是他們通往未來的橋樑......也是我的橋樑。來吧山姆，站起來。
