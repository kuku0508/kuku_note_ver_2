**Ellie**: Hey wait.

**Ellie**: Back in Boston... Back when I was bitten... I wasn't alone. My best friend was there. And she got bit too. We didn't know what to do. So... _[...]_ She says... "Let's just wait it out. Y'know, we can be all poetic and just lose our minds together." _[pause]_ I'm still waiting for my turn.

**Joel**: Ellie—

**Ellie**: Her name was Riley and she was the first to die. And then it was Tess. _[beat]_ And then Sam.

**Joel**: None of that is on you.

**Ellie**: No, you don't understand.

**Joel**: I struggled for a long time with survivin'. And you— ..No matter what... you keep finding something to fight for. Now, I know that's not what you want to hear right now, but it's—

**Ellie**: Swear to me. _[long beat]_ Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies is true.

_[Joel hesitates for a long beat]_

**Joel**: I swear.

_[Ellie distances herself for a longer beat. With all hesitation, she looks up to Joel and finally nods]_

**Ellie**: ...Okay.

**艾利**：嘿，等等。

**艾利**：在波士頓的時候......我被咬的時候......我不是一個人。我最好的朋友也在場，他也被咬了。我們不知該怎麼辦，所以......他就說：「我們先靜觀其變，說不定一起變成瘋子也可以很詩意呀」
